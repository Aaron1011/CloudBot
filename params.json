You can check if your JSON is valid on [this site](http://jsonlint.com/)!\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:\r\n\r\n`python cloudbot.py`\r\n\r\nOn Windows you can usually just double-click `cloudbot.py` to start the bot, as long as you have Python installed correctly.\r\n\r\n## Getting help with CloudBot\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nTo configure your CloudBot, visit the [Config Wiki Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircconfig).\r\n\r\nTo write your own modules, visit the [Module Wiki Page](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Writing-Refresh-Modules).\r\n\r\nMore at the [Wiki Main Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircwiki).\r\n\r\nNote that the configuration page, and the main wiki page, are still for CloudBot Develop.
