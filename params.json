{"name":"CloudBot","tagline":"The easy to use, open source Python IRC Bot!","body":"# CloudBot/DEV\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nCloudBot is a Python IRC bot based on [Skybot](http://git.io/skybot) by [rmmh](http://git.io/rmmh).\r\n\r\n## Getting and using CloudBot\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nGet CloudBot at [https://github.com/ClouDev/CloudBot/zipball/develop](https://github.com/ClouDev/CloudBot/zipball/develop \"Get CloudBot from Github!\").\r\n\r\nUnzip the resulting file, and continue to read this document.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n    \r\nBefore you can run the bot, you need to install a few Python dependencies.\r\nYou are *required* to install `lxml`, and `Enchant` and `PyDNS` are required for some plugins to function.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese can be installed with `pip` (The Python package manager):\r\n\r\n    [sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\n#### How to install `pip`\r\n\r\n    curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py # or download with your browser on windows\r\n    python distribute_setup.py\r\n    easy_install pip\r\n    \r\nIf you are unable to use pip, there are Windows installers for LXML available for [64 bit](https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/l/lxml/lxml-2.3.win-amd64-py2.7.exe) and [32 bit](https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/l/lxml/lxml-2.3.win32-py2.7.exe) versions of Python.\r\n\r\n### Run\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the required dependencies, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:\r\n\r\n`python bot.py`\r\n\r\nThe first time you run the bot it will generate the config file. The next time you run it, it will start normally.\r\n\r\nOn Windows you can usually just double-click `bot.py` to start the bot, as long as you have Python installed correctly.\r\n\r\n## Getting help with CloudBot\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nTo configure your CloudBot, visit the [Config Wiki Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircconfig).\r\n\r\nTo write your own plugins, visit the [Plugin Wiki Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircplugins).\r\n\r\nMore at the [Wiki Main Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircwiki).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nThe developers reside in [#CloudBot](irc://irc.esper.net/cloudbot) on [EsperNet](http://esper.net) and would be glad to help you.\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a bug/have a idea/suggestion, please **open a issue** here on Github.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nCloudBot runs on **Python** *2.7.x*. It is developed on **Ubuntu** *12.04* with **Python** *2.7.3*.\r\n\r\nIt **requires the Python module** lXML.\r\nThe module `Enchant` is needed for the spellcheck plugin.\r\nThe module `PyDNS` is needed for SRV record lookup in the mctools plugin.\r\n\r\n**Windows** users: Windows compatibility some plugins is **broken** (such as ping), but we do intend to add it. Eventually.\r\n\r\n## Example CloudBots\r\n\r\nYou can find a number of example bots in [#CloudBot](irc://irc.esper.net/cloudbot \"Connect via IRC to #CloudBot on irc.esper.net\").\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCloudBot is **licensed** under the **GPL v3** license.
