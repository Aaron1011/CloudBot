This allows everyone to have an identical development environment.\r\n\r\nTo install CloudBotRefresh in Vagrant (both *Unix and Windows), see [docs/installing-vagrant.md](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBotRefresh/blob/possible-documentation-changes/docs/installing-vagrant.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running CloudBot\r\n\r\nBefore you run the bot, rename `config.default` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3.4 -m cloudbot\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.\r\n```\r\npython3.4 CloudBotRefresh/cloudbot/__main__.py\r\n```\r\nSpecify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.\r\n\r\n## Getting help with CloudBot\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nTo configure your CloudBot, visit the [Config Wiki Page](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBotRefresh/wiki/Config).\r\n\r\nTo write your own modules, visit the [Module Wiki Page](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBotRefresh/wiki/Writing-Refresh-Modules).\r\n\r\nMore at the [Wiki Main Page](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBotRefresh/wiki).\r\n\r\nNote that the configuration page, and the main wiki page, are still for CloudBot Develop. The Module Wiki Page has been\r\nrewritten for refresh, but the other pages are outdated.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nThe developers reside in [#CloudBot](irc://irc.esper.net/cloudbot) on [EsperNet](http://esper.net) and would be glad to help you.\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a bug/have a idea/suggestion, please **open a issue** here on Github and contact us on IRC!\r\n\r\n## Example CloudBots\r\n\r\nYou can find a number of example bots in [#CloudBot](irc://irc.esper.net/cloudbot \"Connect via IRC to #CloudBot on irc.esper.net\").\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCloudBot is **licensed** under the **GPL v3** license.
