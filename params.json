{"name":"CloudBot","tagline":"The easy to use, open source Python IRC Bot!","body":"# CloudBot\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nCloudBot is a Python IRC bot based on [Skybot](http://git.io/skybot) by [rmmh](http://git.io/rmmh).\r\n\r\n## Getting and using CloudBot\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nGet CloudBot at [https://github.com/ClouDev/CloudBot/zipball/develop](https://github.com/ClouDev/CloudBot/zipball/develop \"Get CloudBot from Github!\").\r\n\r\nUnzip the resulting file, and continue to read this document.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nBefore you can run the bot, you need to install a few Python dependencies. LXML is required while Enchant and PyDNS are needed for several plugins.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese can be installed with `pip` (The Python package manager):\r\n\r\n    [sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    \r\nIf you use `pip`, you will also need the following packages on linux or `pip` will fail to install the requirements.\r\n   ```python, python-dev, libenchant-dev, libenchant1c2a, libxslt-dev, libxml2-dev.```\r\n\r\n#### How to install `pip`\r\n\r\n    curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py # or download with your browser on windows\r\n    python distribute_setup.py\r\n    easy_install pip\r\n    \r\nIf you are unable to use pip, there are Windows installers for LXML available for [64 bit](https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/l/lxml/lxml-2.3.win-amd64-py2.7.exe) and [32 bit](https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/l/lxml/lxml-2.3.win32-py2.7.exe) versions of Python.\r\n\r\n### Run\r\n\r\nBefore you run the bot, rename `config.default` to `config` and edit it with your preferred settings.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:\r\n\r\n`python bot.py`\r\n\r\nOn Windows you can usually just double-click `bot.py` to start the bot, as long as you have Python installed correctly.\r\n\r\n## Getting help with CloudBot\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nTo configure your CloudBot, visit the [Config Wiki Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircconfig).\r\n\r\nTo write your own plugins, visit the [Plugin Wiki Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircplugins).\r\n\r\nMore at the [Wiki Main Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircwiki).\r\n\r\n(some of the information on the wiki is outdated and needs to be rewritten)\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nThe developers reside in [#CloudBot](irc://irc.esper.net/cloudbot) on [EsperNet](http://esper.net) and would be glad to help you.\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a bug/have a idea/suggestion, please **open a issue** here on Github.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nCloudBot runs on **Python** *2.7.x*. It is currently developed on **Windows** *8* with **Python** *2.7.5*.\r\n\r\nIt **requires the Python module** lXML.\r\nThe module `Enchant` is needed for the spellcheck plugin.\r\nThe module `PyDNS` is needed for SRV record lookup in the mcping plugin.\r\n\r\n**Windows** users: Windows compatibility some plugins is **broken** (such as ping), but we do intend to add it. Eventually.\r\n\r\n## Example CloudBots\r\n\r\nYou can find a number of example bots in [#CloudBot](irc://irc.esper.net/cloudbot \"Connect via IRC to #CloudBot on irc.esper.net\").\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCloudBot is **licensed** under the **GPL v3** license.
